DEMO PROJECTS

if  [Project] Jigsaw/Demo you will find two Product Demo scene's .

- Demo 				: for windows desktop and windows web player

- Demo-mac-ios	: for iPhone, iPad and Mac

IMPORTANT! When publishing to iPhone or iPad, be sure you use the Demo-mac-ios scene
in the build settings and set your Player Settings target platform to arm6 (openGL ES1.1)

- JSDemo			: Javascript Demo.

IMPORTANT ! 
To run the Javascript Sample you need to move the /Jigsaw/Standard Assets folder into the {root}/ of your project.,
The reason for this is because the JigsawPuzzle class we are extending is a C# class and has to be pre-compiled.
The JS script files were commented to avoid import compiler errors so you need to remove the begin /*  & end */ tags.
You have to set the Puzzle editor settings before starting the example. Check the C# sample for the right values.

USAGE

 To Create an Ingame Puzzle

 1. Subclass the JigsawPuzzle Class to a 'custom' JigsawPuzzle Class like 
	( names like DemoJigsawPuzzle, CustomJigsawPuzzle, GameJigsawPuzzle would be advisable for this subclass )

	TIP! Check DemoJigsawPuzzle class in product Demo for reference. You can always re-use and modify that one.      		//re-use和TIP

	the DemoJigsawPuzzle Class is a sub class of JigsawPuzzle that can be used to create the ingame puzzle and handle
	specific call backs , like notification when the puzzle has been solved.     											//Demo 

	The following base functions can/have been overridden :

		- PuzzleStart(); 				: is called when new puzzle is started
		- ActivatePiece(GameObject piece); 		: is called when a 'loose' puzzle piece is selected (start drag)
		- DeactivatePiece(GameObject piece);		: is called when a 'loose' puzzle piece is released (stop drag)
		- PiecePlaced(GameObject piece); 		: is called when a puzzle piece is placed on the puzzle on the right spot
		- PuzzleSolved(int moves, float time);		: is called when the puzzle has been solved	

 2. Add The JigsawMain prefab in | [Project]/Jigsaw/Standard Assets | to the current scene

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

TROUBLESHOOTING

There are issues with the special shaders I created for the normal windows demo
when using these on mac OSX or iOS. Because I am not a shader guru, I created 
the additional demo-mac-ios that uses normal transparent and diffuse shaders.

Because of polycount limitations on the iOS devices , I capped the size of
the puzzle when playing it on an iOS device (and android -> couldnt test that )

If you would use a size that is too large , the app will quit when out of memory
on the iPhone or iPad.
